# AWS-Resource-Tracker-
The AWS Resource Tracker is a shell script that automates the monitoring and logging of AWS resources, such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and IAM users. Using AWS CLI for interaction and jq for JSON parsing, it ensures regular tracking by scheduling the script to run at specified intervals with crontab.
